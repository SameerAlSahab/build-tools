## About AstroROM

AstroROM is an independent ROM project designed with a unique approach to firmware modification. Unlike traditional ROM projects, AstroROM automatically adapts and patches any Samsung ROM, regardless of device model or firmware version. Simply match the GitHub branch to your Android version, and AstroROM handles the rest.

### Project Aim

To create a universal, hassle-free ROM modification solution that will auto patch any samsung firmware and create a flashable zip.
